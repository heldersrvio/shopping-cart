# Shopping Cart

Simple web application that uses React and Routers to create a shopping cart.

It emulates a bookstore. You can go to the 'Shop' section and select the books you want to buy, as well as the amount for each of them. As you select or remove books, the header of the website will update the number of items in the cart and the total price you would pay for them.
